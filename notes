 * In the C language , the semicolon is a statement terminator .

 * A "C" identifier is name used to idetify a variable or a function ... etc
 
 *  - %S alows us to include text 
    - %d alows us to include number 
    
 * We use the comand "Printf" to print a text .
 and "scanf" to let the user insert any information for the keyboard 
 
 * We use // or /*,*/ to write a comment which apears with a grey color in the code .
 
 * Variables ( types , names , value ) 
 Ex : int x = 1;
 
 * bool :
   5 == 5 && 10 > 4  True 
   5 == 6 || 5 > 9  one of these must be correct so we can say that it's true . so this one is false .
   ! which means not , it give us the opposite of the condition 
   Ex !5 == 5 => false 
   
  * If statemnet , else , else if : 
    Ex: 
       if ( the condition ) statemnet;
       else if ( the condition ) statemnet1;
       else if ( the condition ) statemnet2;
       else if ( the condition ) statemnet3;
       else if ( the condition ) statemnet4;
       else statement5;
       
   * 
     printf("%d\n, 3/2) => 1
     printf("%d\n, 3%2) => 1 
       3/2 = ( 1x2 + 1 )
