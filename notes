 * In the C language , the semicolon is a statement terminator .

 * A "C" identifier is name used to idetify a variable or a function ... etc
 
 *  - %S alows us to include text 
    - %d alows us to include number 
    
 * We use the comand "Printf" to print a text .
 and "scanf" to let the user insert any information for the keyboard 
 
 * We use // or /*,*/ to write a comment which apears with a grey color in the code .
  the perpse of using comment is to explain what we have written in our comand so we could understand them quickly .
 
 * Variables ( types , names , value ) 
 Ex : int x = 1;
   explanation : is a specific place in the memory contains a certain value ( text , number , pic , or any type of data )
   

 * bool :
   5 == 5 && 10 > 4  True 
   5 == 6 || 5 > 9  one of these must be correct so we can say that it's true . so this one is false .
   ! which means not , it give us the opposite of the condition 
   Ex !5 == 5 => false 
   
  * If statemnet , else , else if : 
    Ex: 
       if ( the condition ) statemnet;
       else if ( the condition ) statemnet1;
       else if ( the condition ) statemnet2;
       else if ( the condition ) statemnet3;
       else if ( the condition ) statemnet4;
       else statement5;
       
   * 
     printf("%d\n, 3/2) => 1
     printf("%d\n, 3%2) => 1 
       3/2 = ( 1x2 + 1 )
       
   * Switch comand : 
      - we use it to compare only one value with many cases 
     so when it's true a specific statement will appeare .
      - we have to a BREAK after each cases in order not the code 
     to go to the next case 
    
   * pseudo code : is to write your code as a writen expression where 
     any can understand it .
     flow chart : is to write your code as plannes shapes and symbols 
     so it will be easy to read .
   
   * Loops : 
     While loop : is a pre test loop it test a specified conditional expression
                  as long as the expression is true .
     do while loop : work same as while loop but he test the conditions at the 
                     end of the loop . 
     For loop : enable us to make many steps in one line , and is used to 
                control the loop .
